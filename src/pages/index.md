# Kakarot zkEVM - Overview

Welcome to Kakarot zkEVM's documentation! Here you'll find everything there is to know about Kakarot zkEVM, its goals and design.

## What is Kakarot zkEVM?

Kakarot is a zkEVM built in [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/), the provable language that powers [Starknet](https://starkware.co/starknet/) and all the StarknetOS chains (also called CairoVM chains, or Starknet appchains). Itâ€™s an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2, a [so-called zkRollup](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups). Beyond compatibility, Kakarot strives to add new features such as native account abstraction to the EVM. Kakarot's driving ethos is to _Prove, Scale and Innovate_.

## How can I use Kakarot zkEVM?

Kakarot zkEVM is a Ethereum-compatible rollup, which means as a user and developer, you can interact with Kakarot zkEVM in the same way you would interact with Ethereum mainnet or any other Ethereum-based chain (use Metamask, Rainbow, build with Foundry or Hardhat, etc.). Change the RPC URL and it "just works".

All differences between Ethereum and Kakarot zkEVM are recorded in the [Differences between Kakarot and Ethereum](differences) page in this documentation website.

### As a user, how can I interact with Kakarot zkEVM?

Head over to the [survival guide](survival-guide) section to find useful links for our alpha testnet. Change the RPC URL and it "just works".

Quick start - Adding a new network to Metamask: open the Metamask extension. Click "Add Network". Choose "Add Network Manually". Then fill the fields:

| Category       | Value                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Network Name   | Kakarot zkEVM                        |
| RPC URL        | https://rpc.testnet.kakarot.org      |
| Chain Id       | 10710711648                          |
| Symbol         | ETH                                  |
| Block Explorer | https://explorer.testnet.kakarot.org |

### As a developer, how can I build on Kakarot zkEVM?

For developers as well, change the RPC url, and it "just works".

## What differentiates Kakarot zkEVM?

Kakarot is the only zkEVM fully built on an intermediary zkVM (the CairoVM). In this sense, Kakarot is closer to an EVM client than other zkEVMs.
